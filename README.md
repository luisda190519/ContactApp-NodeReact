# Contact App

This is a web application where we can save contacts, each user must register, and create users.

The reason for this app, is to consolidate the basics of creating web applications with the use of front-end frameworks, in this case React js was used, with Vite JS as the development environment.

## Deployment

To deploy this project, it is executed in 2 parts, the front-end part and the back-end part.

For the front-end navigate to its corresponding folder and run this command:

```bash
  npm run dev
```
For the back-end navigate to its corresponding folder and run this command:

```bash
  npm test
```




## Lessons Learned

With this project I learned to use React JS, one of the most famous and used front-end frameworks today, with these basics, the creation of web apps will be more professional and although I would like to focus on back-end having this knowledge is a great help.
